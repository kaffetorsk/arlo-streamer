# arlo-streamer
Python script that turns arlo cameras into continuous streams through ffmpeg
This allow arlo cameras to be used in the NVR of your choosing. (e.g. [Frigate](https://frigate.video/))

The streams will provide an "idle" picture when the camera is not actively streaming.
Motion will trigger an active stream, replacing the "idle" picture with the actual camera stream.

**Note:** For ideal operation, the arlo cameras should not be set to record on motion in the arlo app. This slows down stream setup significantly, leading to loss of valuable frames at the start of the event. A common approach is to choose push notification only, then disable notifications for the arlo app.

## Usage
For frigate, see this [example](examples/frigate)

Config through environment variables, if `.env` is present it will be checked for variables.
Where applicable `{name}` will be replaced by camera name.
### Required
```
ARLO_USER: Arlo account name
ARLO_PASS: Arlo password
IMAP_HOST: imap server to use for 2FA (see [pyaarlo](https://github.com/twrecked/pyaarlo) for details)
IMAP_USER: imap account
IMAP_PASS: imap password
FFMPEG_OUT: out-string for ffmpeg. (e.g. -c:v copy -c:a copy -f flv rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/{name})
```
### Optional
```
MOTION_TIMEOUT: How long to provide active stream after motion (in seconds) (default: 60)
MQTT_BROKER: If specified, will be used to publish snapshots and status, and control the camera (see MQTT).
MQTT_PORT: broker port (default: 1883)
MQTT_USER: broker username. Not setting this will result in an anonymous connection (default: None)
MQTT_PASS: broker password (default: None)
MQTT_TOPIC_PICTURE: snapshots will be published to this topic. (default: arlo/picture)
MQTT_TOPIC_STATUS: status will be published to this topic. (default: arlo/status/{name})
MQTT_TOPIC_CONTROL: control will be read on this topic. (default: arlo/control/{name})
MQTT_TOPIC_MOTION: motion events will be published to this topic. (default: arlo/motion/{name})
MQTT_RECONNECT_INTERVAL: Wait this amount before retrying connection to broker (in seconds) (default: 5)
STATUS_INTERVAL: Time between published status messages (in seconds) (default: 120)
DEBUG: True enables full debug (default: False)
PYAARLO_BACKEND: Pyaarlo backend. (default determined by pyaarlo). Options are `mqtt` and `sse`.
PYAARLO_REFRESH_DEVICES: Pyaarlo backend device refresh interval (in hours) (default: never)
PYAARLO_STREAM_TIMEOUT: Pyaarlo backend event stream timeout (in seconds) (default: never)
PYAARLO_STORAGE_DIR: Pyaarlo storage_dir. Define it if you want to change the Pyaarlo storage directory. (default determined by pyaarlo)
PYAARLO_ECDH_CURVE: Allowing you defining the ECDH CURVE to use during pyaarlo authentication
IMAP_GRAB_ALL: Grabs all mails in the inbox, to avoid slow indexing problems (default: False)
IMAP_DELETE_AFTER: Deletes mail after extracting code for 2fa (default: False)
LAST_IMAGE_IDLE: Set last frame as idle image for the camera (default: False)
DEFAULT_RESOLUTION: Default resolution for the idle video (default: (1280, 768))
```
### Running
```
python main.py
```
or
```
docker run -d --env-file .env kaffetorsk/arlo-streamer
```
### MQTT
#### Pictures
JSON with "payload" set to base64 encoded image. "filename" set to "timestamp camera_name.jpg"
#### Status
JSON
#### Motion
Boolean
#### Control
##### Cameras
Payload in a simple string.
```
"START" and "STOP": Starts and stops active stream
"SNAPSHOT": Requests snapshot to be taken
```
##### Base Stations
JSON payload, all keys are optional.
```
{
    "mode": name of mode,
    "siren": "on"/"off"/{"duration": X seconds, "volume": 1-8}
}
```
Note: `"siren": "on"` defaults to 300 seconds, volume 8
## Troubleshooting
### socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
Most likely due to Arlo backend MQTT event stream not working.
Try:
```
PYAARLO_BACKEND=sse
```
### Motion trigger stops after a while
Try:
```
PYAARLO_REFRESH_DEVICES=3
PYAARLO_STREAM_TIMEOUT=180
```
