# arlo-streamer
Python script that turns arlo cameras into continuous streams through ffmpeg
This allow arlo cameras to be used in the NVR of your choosing. (e.g. [Frigate](https://frigate.video/))

The streams will provide an "idle" picture when the camera is not actively streaming.
Motion will trigger an active stream, replacing the "idle" picture with the actual camera stream.

## Usage
Config through environment variables, if `.env` is present it will be checked for variables.
Where applicable `{name}` will be replaced by camera name.
